# ABSTRACT: classical 'risk' board game

# although it's not strictly needed to load POE::Kernel manually (since
# MooseX::POE will load it anyway), we're doing it here to make sure poe
# will use tk event loop. this can also be done by loading module tk
# before poe, for example if we load app::cpan2pkg::tk::main before
# moosex::poe... but better be safe than sorry, and doing things
# explicitly is always better.

=head1 NAME

Games::Risk - classical 'risk' board game

=head1 VERSION

version 3.112820

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Risk is a strategic turn-based board game. Players control armies, with
which they attempt to capture territories from other players. The goal
of the game is to control all the territories (C<conquer the world>)
through the elimination of the other players. Using area movement, Risk
ignores realistic limitations, such as the vast size of the world, and
the logistics of long campaigns.

This distribution implements a graphical interface for this game.

C<Games::Risk> itself tracks everything needed for a risk game. It is
also used as a heap for C<Games::Risk::Controller> POE session.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 run

    Games::Risk->run;

Start the application, with an initial batch of C<@modules> to build.

=head2 maps

    my @modules = Games::Risk->maps;

Return a list of module names under L<Games::Risk::Map> namespace.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item * my $game = Games::Risk->new

Create a new risk game. No params needed. Note: this class implements a
singleton scheme.

=back

=head2 Accessors

The following accessors (acting as mutators, ie getters and setters) are
available for C<Games::Risk> objects:

=over 4

=item * armies()

armies left to be placed.

=item * map()

the current C<Games::Risk::Map> object of the game.

=back

=head2 Public methods

=over 4

=item * $game->cards_reset;

Put back all cards given to players to the deck.

=item * $game->destroy;

Break all circular references in C<$game>, to reclaim all objects
referenced.

=item * $game->player_lost( $player )

Remove $player from the list of active players.

=item * my $player = $game->player_next()

Return the next player to play, or undef if the turn is over. Of course,
players that have lost will never be returned.

=item * my @players = $game->players()

Return the C<Games::Risk::Player> objects of the current game. Note that
some of those players may have already lost.

=item * my @players = $game->players_active;

Return the list of active players (Games::Risk::Player objects).

=item * $game->players_reset( @players )

Remove all players, and replace them by C<@players>.

=item * $game->players_reset_turn()

Mark all players to be in "turn to do", effectively marking them as
still in play. Typically called during initial army placing, or real
game start.

=item * $game->send_to_all($event, @params)

Send C<$event> (with C<@params>) to all players.

=item * $game->send_to_one($player, $event, @params)

Send C<$event> (with C<@params>) to one C<$player>.

=back

=head1 TODO

This is a work in progress. While there are steady improvements, here's
a rough list (with no order implied whatsoever) of what you can expect
in the future for C<Games::Risk>:

=over 4

=item * screen to customize the new game to be played - DONE - 1.1.0

=item * config save / restore

=item * saving / loading game

=item * network play

=item * maps theming

=item * i18n - DONE - 3.101370: gui, 3.112590: maps

=item * better ais - DONE - 0.5.0: blitzkrieg ai, 0.5.1: hegemon ai

=item * country cards - DONE - 0.6.0

=item * continents bonus - DONE - 0.3.3

=item * continents bonus localized

=item * statistics

=item * prettier map coloring

=item * missions

=item * remove all the FIXMEs in the code :-)

=item * do-or-die mode (slanning's request) - DONE - 1.1.2

=item * "attack trip" planning (slanning's request)

=item * other...

=back

However, the game is already totally playable by now: reinforcements,
continent bonus, country cards, different artificial intelligences...
Therefore, version 1.0.0 has been released with those basic
requirements. Except new features soon!

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests to C<bug-games-risk at
rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at

bug as I make changes.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I definitely recommend you to buy a C<risk> board game and play with
friends, you'll have an exciting time - much more than with this poor
electronic copy.

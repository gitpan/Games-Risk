=head1 NAME

Games::Risk::AI::Blitzkrieg - easy ai that does blitzkrieg attacks

=head1 VERSION

version 3.112820

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ai = Games::Risk::AI::Blitzkrieg->new(\%params);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a quite easy ai for risk, that plays according to
a blitzkrieg strategy. It will piles up new armies in one country, and
then follow a random path from this attack base.

=head1 METHODS

This class implements (or inherits) all of those methods (further described in
C<Games::Risk::AI>):

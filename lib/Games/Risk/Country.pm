Games::Risk::Country - map country

=head1 VERSION

version 3.112820

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 continent

A L<Games::Risk::Continent> object in which the country is located.

set to C<greyval()>) used to draw the country on the grey-scale map.

=head2 id

Alias for C<greyval>.

=head2 coordx

The x location of the country capital.

=head2 coordy

The y location of the country capital.

=head2 connections

A list of country ids that can be accessed from the country. Note that
it's not always reciprocical (connections can be one-way).

=head2 owner

A C<Games::Risk::Player> object currently owning the country.

=head2 armies

Number of armies currently in the country.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 neighbours

    my @neighbours = $country->neighbours;

Return the list of C<$country>'s neighbours (L<Games::Risk::Country>
objects).

=head2 is_neighbour

    my $bool = $country->is_neighbour( $c );

otherwise.

=head1 NAME

Games::Risk::Resources - utility module to load bundled resources

=head1 VERSION

version 3.112820

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Games::Risk::Resources qw{ image };
    my $image = get_image('actexit16');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a focal point to access all resources bundled with
C<Games::Risk>. Indeed, instead of each package to reinvent its loading
mechanism, this package provides handy functions to do that.

Moreover, by loading all the images at the same location, it will ensure
that they are not loaded twice, cutting memory eating.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

C<Games::Risk::Resources> deals with various resources bundled within
the distribution. It doesn't export anything by default, but the
following subs are available for your import pleasure.

=head2 Image resources

The images used for the GUI are bundled and loaded as C<Tk::Photo> of
C<$poe_main_window>.

=over 4

=item my $img = get_image( $name )

Return the Tk image called C<$name>. It can be directly used within Tk.

=back

=head2 Map resources

Map resources are playable maps, to allow more playing fun.

=over 4

=item my $path = map_path( $name )

Return the absolute path of the map C<$name>.

=item my @names = maps( )

Return the names of all the maps bundled with C<Games::Risk>.

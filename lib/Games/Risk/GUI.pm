=head1 NAME

Games::Risk::GUI - gui multiplexer poe session

=head1 VERSION

version 3.112820

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Games::Risk> uses various windows to display the game: the board of
course, but also the window displaying the cards owned by the player,
and some others.

Depending on the event, the controller needs to send events to a given
window, or even to more than one. But it is clearly not the controller's
job to know how the GUI works!

Therefore, C<Games::Risk::GUI> is a poe session that will receive all
the events fired by the controller, and forward them to the other
windows. Of course, the controller now fires its events only to the
C<Games::Risk::GUI> session.

This poe session answers to the C<gui> L<POE> alias.

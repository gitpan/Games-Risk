=head1 BASIS

Each player has territories marked with her color. In the mark there is
a number indicating the number of armies in that territory.


=head1 PLAYING

=head2 Reinforcements

When it is your turn the first step is to distribute new armies. In the
status bar at the bottom you can see the additional armies you can
deply. Each click on the territory you own will add one army to that
territory (right-click to remove an army, mouse wheel works also). The
number of armies you can add indicating each turn is determined by the
number of territories you own and the continents you control when your
turn arrives. In Addition you can get further armies by exchanging cards
for armies.

During this time you can click on the "undo all" button to start the distribution again.

Once you distributed all the armies you have to click on the "ready for
attack" arrow (or press enter).


=head2 Attack

Then select one of your territories to attack from and select one of the
neigbouring enemy territories to attack to. Throwing the die and
calculating the results will be done automatically.

You can repeat this as many times as you want or as long as you have
more than 1 armies in a territory.

When you kill all the armies in the neighbouring territory you will move
some of your armies to the captured territory. A pop-up window will let
you pick the number of armies to move.
